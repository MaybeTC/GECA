# Project plan

I plan to use random generation in the project to make the texture and color matching of the generated ground and buildings.

With regard to "Paint a picture in code", I will use the code to draw "neon lights" of buildings, which will change color with the rhythm of music.

I will create Component model of racing cars and buildings.

And I will use unity3d modeling to create 3d models of racing cars and some background building models myself.
